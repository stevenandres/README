# How I Work

## Purpose

This perpetually work-in-progress document is an attempt at an efficient way to communicate working values, styles, quirks, and norms. This is **not** intended as orders to change how you work to bend to my whims. Rather, this is to quickly communicate how I currently work best to help accelerate our trust-building. How we interact will be a shared project that we continuously interate.

## Inspiration

Does this seem weird? That is by design. It's also largely fallen out of favor, but it was all the rage in 2018. This README is inspired by an early example from [Roy Rapoport (2016](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TPSwdqDqVfWG9anfiOjGUjk0k6zQDij5xPvatPg7NFE/),[2018)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1df5MALZKZU6lOeIXUiO-h6ReFM3KuIpnapSE97IZnX4/) and others from 2018 like [Michael Lopp](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands), [Molly White](https://github.com/molly/manager-README), [Richard Money](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=61BC36893133C60A!1165&authkey=!APyYqIf2yhV-OzE), [Katie Wilde](https://github.com/KatieLo/README), and [Aaron Lerch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1usdIfRIqOCRUOaMsElQp9Rqu8WYgBypdsxqeZaRCcj0/).  

## Motivation

What gets me up in the morning? Challenging and interesting problems that can be solved by diverse, energized teammates.

## What I should be doing

* Attract, retain, and grow high performing team members
* Foster a collaborative and innovative team culture
* Thoroughly explain the objective and key results for the team
* Stand back allowing talented team members and SME to execute within constraints 
* Solicit and provide timely suggestions on improvement
* Be accountable for project success (the buck stops here)

_If you feel I am not meeting these goals, you would be doing me a favor by informing me promptly._

## Feedback

The term _feedback_ has been loaded with negative connotations; I prefer the framework of _suggestons for improvement_ because who wouldn't welcome a suggestion?

* __SAFETY__: It is my job to foster an environment where you feel you will not be punished for voicing dissenting opinions
* __EFFORT__: Voicing your opinion to me (and other team members) should be common and not require bravery 
* __TIMELY__: Suggestions are most impactful if they are delivered as near the subject event as possible
* __SPECIFIC__: Without specificity (examples), suggestions are unactionable and less impactful
* __OFTEN__: If we feel safe, specific, low-effort, timely suggestions should be a social norm (daily, hourly)
* __FORUM__: We will not wait for a 1:1 to provide suggestions; a timely Slack direct message is effective
* __PRAISE__: Use (or build) workplace kudos-awarding mechanisms to make successes public
* __DEFAULT__: The absence of suggestions is a signal itself; keep steady on your current course
* __ACTION__: You are responsible to think critically on the gift you have received and what next steps to take (including discarding the gift)
