# How I Work

## Purpose

This perpetually work-in-progress document is an attempt at an efficient way to communicate working values, styles, quirks, and norms. This is **not** intended as orders to change how you work to bend to my whims. Rather, this is to quickly communicate how I currently work best to help accelerate our trust-building. How we interact will be a shared project that we continuously interate.

## Inspiration

Does this seem weird? That is by design. It's also largely fallen out of favor, but it was all the rage in 2018. This README is inspired by an early example from [Roy Rapoport (2016](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TPSwdqDqVfWG9anfiOjGUjk0k6zQDij5xPvatPg7NFE/),[2018)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1df5MALZKZU6lOeIXUiO-h6ReFM3KuIpnapSE97IZnX4/) and others from 2018 like [Michael Lopp](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands), [Molly White](https://github.com/molly/manager-README), [Richard Money](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=61BC36893133C60A!1165&authkey=!APyYqIf2yhV-OzE), [Katie Wilde](https://github.com/KatieLo/README), and [Aaron Lerch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1usdIfRIqOCRUOaMsElQp9Rqu8WYgBypdsxqeZaRCcj0/).
