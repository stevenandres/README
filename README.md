# How I Work
[<img alt="Sudo comic from XKCD" title="Proper User Policy apparently means Simon Says." align="right" width="300px" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sandwich.png" />](https://xkcd.com/149/)

This perpetually work-in-progress document is an attempt at an efficient way to communicate working values, styles, quirks, and norms. This is **not** intended as orders to change how you work to bend to my whims. Rather, this is to quickly communicate how I currently work best to help accelerate our trust-building. How we interact will be a shared project that we continuously interate. 

## Inspiration

Does this seem weird? That is by design. This README is inspired by examples from [Roy Rapoport](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1df5MALZKZU6lOeIXUiO-h6ReFM3KuIpnapSE97IZnX4/), [Michael Lopp](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands), [Molly White](https://github.com/molly/manager-README), [Richard Money](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=61BC36893133C60A!1165&authkey=!APyYqIf2yhV-OzE), and [Aaron Lerch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1usdIfRIqOCRUOaMsElQp9Rqu8WYgBypdsxqeZaRCcj0/). While the format has largely fallen out of favor, it was all the rage in 2018. 

## Motivation

What gets me up in the morning? Challenging and interesting problems that I can solve with help from diverse, talented, and energized team members.

## What I should be doing

* Attract, retain, and grow high performing team members
* Foster a collaborative and innovative team culture
* Thoroughly explain the objective and key results for the team
* Stand back allowing talented team members and SME to execute within constraints 
* Solicit and provide timely suggestions on improvement
* Be accountable for project success (the buck stops here)

_If you feel I am not meeting these goals, you would be doing me a favor by informing me promptly._

## Feedback

The term _feedback_ has been loaded with negative connotations; I prefer the framework of _suggestons for improvement_ because who wouldn't welcome a suggestion?

* __SAFETY__: It is my job to foster an environment where you feel you will not be punished for voicing dissenting opinions
* __EFFORT__: Voicing your opinion to me (and other team members) should be common and not require bravery 
* __TIMELY__: Suggestions are most impactful if they are delivered as near the subject event as possible
* __SPECIFIC__: Without specificity (examples), suggestions are unactionable and less impactful
* __OFTEN__: If we feel safe, specific, low-effort, timely suggestions should be a social norm (daily, hourly)
* __FORUM__: We will not wait for a 1:1 to provide suggestions; a timely Slack direct message is effective
* __PRAISE__: Use (or build) workplace kudos-awarding mechanisms to make successes public
* __INERTIA__: The absence of suggestions is a signal itself; keep steady on your current course
* __ACTION__: You are responsible to think critically on the gift you have received and what next steps to take (including discarding the gift)

## Communication

I prefer direct, non-sugar-coated communication. You should never leave an interaction wondering _what does Steven really think?_ Here are my loosely-ranked communication methods and usage guidelines (hover over emoji):

method | format/urgency  | examples | notes
-------|--------------|----------|------
[__SLACK__](#slack) | [🔜](# "async") [⌛](# "ephemeral") [📝](# "text") timely | bulk of our comms | preferred method
[__HUDDLE__](#huddle) | [🔄](# "synchronous") [⌛](# "ephemeral") [🎧](# "audio") timely | brainstorming, status check-in | no screensharing
[__MEET__](#meet) | [🔄](# "synchronous") [⌛](# "ephemeral") [🎥](# "video") scheduled  | x-team collab, 1:1 | not for status
[__SMS__](#sms) | [🔜](# "async") [🔒](# "durable") [📝](# "text") important | non-secret urgent notify | not for secrets
[__CALL__](#call) | [🔄](# "synchronous") [⌛](# "ephemeral") [🎧](# "audio") emergency  | SEV, personal crisis | 24/7, keep calling
[__EMAIL__](#email) | [🔜](# "async") [🔒](# "durable") [📝](# "text") routine  | notifications, req'd reading | discussion not needed
[__GDOC__](#gdocs) | [🔜](# "async") [🔒](# "durable") [📝](# "text") varies  | design docs, reports | use instead of long Slack posts
[__TICKET__](#tickets) | [🔜](# "async") [🔒](# "durable") [📝](# "text") varies | tasks, projects | capture work effort here
[__DASHBOARD__](#dashboards) | [🔜](# "async") [📸](# "snapshot") [📊](# "graphs") varies  | overall status | measure progress
