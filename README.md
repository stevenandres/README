# How I Work
[<img alt="Sudo comic from XKCD" title="If you find this funny, you're my kind of people" align="right" width="300px" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sandwich.png" />](https://xkcd.com/149/)

This perpetually work-in-progress document is an attempt at an efficient way to communicate working values, styles, __quirks__, and norms. This is **NOT** intended as orders to change how you work to bend to my whims. Rather, this is to quickly communicate how I currently work best to help accelerate our trust-building. How we interact will be a shared project that we continuously interate. 

## Inspiration

Does this seem weird? That is by design. This README is inspired by examples from [Roy Rapoport](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1df5MALZKZU6lOeIXUiO-h6ReFM3KuIpnapSE97IZnX4/), [Michael Lopp](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands), [Molly White](https://github.com/molly/manager-README), [Richard Money](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=61BC36893133C60A!1165&authkey=!APyYqIf2yhV-OzE), and [Aaron Lerch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1usdIfRIqOCRUOaMsElQp9Rqu8WYgBypdsxqeZaRCcj0/). While the format has largely fallen out of favor, it was all the rage in 2018. 

## Motivation

What gets me up in the morning? Challenging and interesting problems that I can solve with help from diverse, talented, and energized team members.

## What I should be doing

* Attract, retain, and grow high performing team members
* Foster a collaborative and innovative team culture
* Thoroughly explain the objective and key results for the team
* Stand back allowing talented team members and SME to execute within constraints 
* Solicit and provide timely suggestions on improvement
* Be accountable for project success (the buck stops here)

_If you feel I am not meeting these goals, you would be doing me a favor by informing me promptly._

## Feedback

The term _feedback_ has been loaded with negative connotations; I prefer the framework of _suggestons for improvement_ because who wouldn't welcome a suggestion?

* __SAFETY__: It is my job to foster an environment where you feel you will not be punished for voicing dissenting opinions
* __EFFORT__: Voicing your opinion to me (and other team members) should be common and not require bravery 
* __TIMELY__: Suggestions are most impactful if they are delivered as near the subject event as possible
* __SPECIFIC__: Without specificity (examples), suggestions are unactionable and less impactful
* __OFTEN__: If we feel safe, specific, low-effort, timely suggestions should be a social norm (daily, hourly)
* __FORUM__: We will not wait for a 1:1 to provide suggestions; a timely Slack direct message is effective
* __PRAISE__: Use (or build) workplace kudos-awarding mechanisms to make successes public
* __INERTIA__: The absence of suggestions is a signal itself; keep steady on your current course
* __ACTION__: You are responsible to think critically on the gift you have received and what next steps to take (including discarding the gift)

## Communication

I prefer direct, non-sugar-coated communication. You should never leave an interaction wondering _what does Steven really think?_ Here are my loosely-ranked communication methods and usage guidelines (hover over emoji):

method | format/urgency  | examples | notes
-------|--------------|----------|------
[__SLACK__](#slack) | [🔜](# "async") [⌛](# "ephemeral") [📝](# "text") timely | bulk of our comms | preferred method
[__HUDDLE__](#huddle) | [🔄](# "synchronous") [⌛](# "ephemeral") [🎧](# "audio") timely | brainstorming, status check-in | no screensharing
[__MEET__](#meet) | [🔄](# "synchronous") [⌛](# "ephemeral") [🎥](# "video") scheduled  | x-team collab, 1:1 | not for status
[__SMS__](#sms) | [🔜](# "async") [🔒](# "durable") [📝](# "text") important | non-secret urgent notify | not for secrets
[__CALL__](#call) | [🔄](# "synchronous") [⌛](# "ephemeral") [🎧](# "audio") emergency  | SEV, personal crisis | 24/7, keep calling
[__EMAIL__](#email) | [🔜](# "async") [🔒](# "durable") [📝](# "text") routine  | notifications, req'd reading | discussion not needed
[__GDOC__](#gdocs) | [🔜](# "async") [🔒](# "durable") [📝](# "text") varies  | design docs, reports | use instead of long Slack posts
[__TICKET__](#tickets) | [🔜](# "async") [🔒](# "durable") [📝](# "text") varies | tasks, projects | capture work effort here
[__DASHBOARD__](#dashboards) | [🔜](# "async") [📸](# "snapshot") [📊](# "graphs") varies  | overall status | measure progress


### Slack

* Ephemeral instant messages are useful for a short amount of time; consider them volatile memory
* Discussions via Slack are fantastic; once a decision is made, commmit that to a [GDoc](#gdocs)/[Ticket](#tickets)
* Avoid 3+ paragraph messages; you likely chose the wrong format
* Detailed announcements or status updates should link to a [GDoc](#gdocs) or sometimes [Email](#email)
* Use our __private team channel__ as much as possible so that we distribute awareness evenly
* Direct Message (DM) me __whenever you'd like,__ 24/7; my response time will depend on my availability
* If something is __urgent__ during working hours and I haven't responded to you fast enough, [ring me](https://slack.com/help/articles/216771908-) for a noisy alert that will steal my focus
* For __after hours emergencies,__ skip Slack and [call](#call) my phone (listed in Slack) at any time
* If you DM me something I think is valuable to share, I'll ask if we can __move to the team channel__
* [__Thread replies__](https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-) wherever possible as it help organize discussions
* I may not catch up to a thread until the end of the day; use [@mentions](https://slack.com/help/articles/205240127-) to grab my attention
* Do not __thread direct messages;__ I depend on the new message indicator which will not fire on threaded DMs
* __Avoid multi-party group DMs;__ if there's ongoing discussion, let's make that a #proj-example channel
* Setup your [__availabilty hours__](https://slack.com/help/articles/214908388-Pause-notifications-with-Do-Not-Disturb#set-a-notification-schedule); global workforces must respect timezones
* Do not check __Slack after hours__; we all need a healthy unwind in the evenings/weekends
* Do not check Slack when you are __sick or taking time off__; concentrate on your physical/mental health
* If I Slack the team channel after your working hours, __do not respond__ until you return to your working hours
* [__Schedule DM__](https://slack.com/help/articles/1500012915082-) to be delivered during the recipient's working hours
* Caveat: Slack does not currently allow scheduling _threaded replies_ 
* If you are taking time off, set a __[Slack status](https://slack.com/help/articles/201864558-)__ with the _clear notification after_ set to the date of your return
* If you need some focus time, set a 🧠 status rather than _appearing offline_ (which sends the wrong signal)
* Use the [Google Calendar](https://slack.com/help/articles/206329808-) app to change your status when you're in meetings so I know to not expect a quick response from you

### Huddle

* Slack's [Huddle](https://slack.com/help/articles/4402059015315-) feature is useful for non-visual brainstorming or discussions
* Video conferencing is mentally taxing (engaging our visual cortex); if we're just chatting, try Huddle
* Team bonding can sometimes be enhanced with audio-only Huddle stand-ups or check-ins since you are less concerned about how you (or your room) looks and concentrate on the content; your mileage may vary depending on team dynamics
* If you're using Huddle screenshare, you've missed the point and should switch to [Meet](#meet)
* Share document links in Slack and allow people to follow along at their own pace and screen resolution (bonus: cursor tracking)
* Intra-team color commentary while jointly watching a preso/all-hands can sometimes be a fun team bonding experience

### Meet

* Use __judiciously,__ as synchronous comms are expensive investments of participants' time (and scheduling)
* Meetings always __run over__; schedule meetings to start at __:05__ or __:35__ past the hour
* Like in high school, first five minutes of a meeting are the "travel time" between classrooms
* Use first five minutes for coffee refills, snacks, bathroom, mental break, or social chit-chat
* Meetings __start promptly__ at :05 or :35 past the hour; catch up socially during other events
* Leave early for another committment with a silent 👋 hand-wave to not interrupt the discussion
* __No agenda? No attenda!__ Attach [agendas](#agendas) or at least bullets in the event description
* [Attach GDocs](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/6192039) to events instead of pasting links (easier to access)
* Avoid __screensharing docs__; send in Slack or in-meeting chat to allow people to follow along at their own pace and screen resolution (bonus: cursor tracking)
* __Cameras off__ when reading docs; __cameras on__ when you're ready to contribute
* Leave the camera off while __walking or driving__ (should be exception not the norm)

### SMS

* Should be avoided in favor of Slack in almost all circumstances
* Useful for urgent, efficient one-way notifications (e.g., flood on 4th floor bathroom) 
* Assume cleartext and everyone is watching; __NEVER__ include secret information
* May include nudges to more trusted methods (e.g., "hey, check Slack ASAP")

### Call

* My toll-free number is listed in my Slack profile and may be used __24/7 for urgent matters__
* Calls should be used when Slack is unavaiable or in emergencies (not instead of Slack)
* If you're wondering whether you should wake me up, please __wake me up__
* If I do not answer at first, please __call again repeatedly__ instead of leaving voicemail
* If our workplace has automated notification systems (e.g., PagerDuty), use those
* [Signal](https://signal.org/) __encrypted voice__ is preferred to public telephony, if possible

### Email

* Even though the _cool kids_ say email is dead, there is a time and place for it
* Useful for __one-way notifications__ or alerts, in addition to appropriate Slack channels, where no reply is needed
* I practice quasi-[Inbox Zero](https://joefallon.net/2013/10/controlling-your-email-and-inbox-zero/) so email tasks to complete are useful versus Slack that may scroll off my screen and be forgotten
* Use the __notify by email__ checkbox when sharing [GDocs](#gdocs) with me, so I remember to read the doc
* Very few situations require internal person-to-person emails; use Slack DM instead
* Assume all emails will eventually be read by __opposing counsel__; write as if everyone is watching
* Use __bcc__ for large distributions and disclose in the first line of the body (e.g., "bcc: sec-leads, counsel")
* Think long and hard __before you reply-all__; usually indicates a pivot to Slack is better
* My goal is to read all new emails __the same day__, typically in the afternoon/evening hours
* I try to reply to emails (where needed) within __five days__; if the matter is more urgent, don't use email
* I tend to trim previous quoted replies except for the most recent; a weird frugality of bytes quirk
* Email signatures are unnecessary __internally__; I don't use them and will trim them from replies
* Avoid giving redundant (email address) or useless (street address) information in email signatures
* Phone numbers are far more important than job titles to an external recipient
* Linking to an availability booking calendar is more important than social media
* Email disclaimers are non-binding and ridiculous (particularly at the end of a message)

### GDocs

### Tickets

### Dashboards

### Agendas

* Agenda [GDoc](#gdocs) can double as meeting notes; use reverse order with most recent meeting at top, allowing new team members to catch up on the meeting's history
